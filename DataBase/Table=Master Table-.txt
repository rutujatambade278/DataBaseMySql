   What is  Join ?
a join is an operation 
that combines rows from one or more tables are based 
a releated column between them  (PK--FK)
 
joins are essential for retriveing data from multiple tables 
in relational database.
Different types of joins:
INNER  JOIN
Description:
	Returns  only rows  that have matching values in both tables
Use case:
	When  you want to retriever recrods  that exist in both tables
 
Example:
if you have a customers table and orders tables,
an INNERT join will return only customers who have placed orders
LEFT JOIN
Description:
	 Returns all rows from the left table 
     and the matched rows from the right table. 
	 If there’s no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
 
use Case:
	Useful when you want to see all records from one table 
	the related records from another table, if they exist.
	  Left					  right
     Customers Table    ------ Orders Tables
Example:
	 List all customers and their orders,
     including customers who have not placed any orders 
     (they will show with NULL for order details).
 
RIGHT JOIN
 
Description: Returns all rows from the right table
			  and the matched rows from the left table.
               If there’s no match, 
               NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
Use Case:
			Similar to LEFT JOIN, but it focuses on the right table.
Example:
			List all orders and the corresponding customers,
			including orders that don’t have associated customers.
 
Customers Table
	CustomerID	CustomerName	ContactName
	1			John Doe		John
	2			Jane Smith		Jane

	101			1				2024-01-10
	102			1				2024-01-15
	103			2				2024-02-01
    104			4				2024-03-15
 
"To retrieve all customers along with their orders (if any)"
SELECT  Customers.CustomerID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate
FROM  Customers  
LEFT JOIN  Orders ON  Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
 
Output
 
CustomerID	CustomerName	OrderID		OrderDate
1			John Doe		101  		2024-01-10
1			John Doe		102			2024-01-15
2			Jane Smith      103			2024-02-01
3			Mike Johnson	NULL		NULL	
 
RIGHT JOIN
 
SELECT  Customers.CustomerID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN  ON Orders ON  Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
 
Out put of RIGHT JOIN
 
 
CustomerID	CustomerName	OrderID		OrderDate
1			John Doe		101  		2024-01-10
1			John Doe		102			2024-01-15
2			Jane Smith      103			2024-02-01
NULL		NULL		    104			2024-03-15
